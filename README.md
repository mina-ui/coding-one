contents: 
weekly challenges: what I struggled with most, due to my poor attendance at uni first term, and the fact I was too nervous and disappointed in myself to ask for help. I have addressed these by: speaking to disability advisor for mentoring, and information on counselling, and have now moved closer to universirty with the aim of 100% attendance.
two-player game: I chose connect four, and would cross-refewrence with a tutorial (linked in code), in particular when calculating the winning moves. other resources I used include: google (w3schools, stackoverflow etc) and Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes
not included: Lecture notes, and revision material made (can be given if needed, just didn't see it in the assesment brief)
